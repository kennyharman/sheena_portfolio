                        This project showcases the design and mockup creation process for a hypothetical beverage product: "Canned Duck Milk." Inspired by a previous project involving animal morphing, this concept jokingly imagines a company producing milk from a genetically altered duck-cow hybrid. <br/><br/>

                        The final designs include mockups for three variations: Regular, Chocolate, and Strawberry Duck Milk.
                        The creation process began in Adobe Illustrator, where a dieline was used to lay out the canâ€™s design. This included vector illustrations and text elements, ensuring a clean and scalable design. The dieline was then imported into Adobe Photoshop, where blank can templates were used to create realistic mockups. Techniques such as clipping masks, gradient shadows, blending modes, and compositing were employed to bring the mockups to life. <br/><br/>

                        This project demonstrates a variety of design and technical skills, including:<br/><br/>

                            </li>

                        While the concept itself is intended as a joke, the project highlights serious technical expertise in design, compositing, and mockup creation. It serves as an example of pushing creative boundaries while refining advanced design techniques.
